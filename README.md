# EEG Analysis in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: Statistical Analysis and Disease Characterization

## Project description

The EEG-analysis-in-patients-with-Parkinson-disease project was a comprehensive initiative that I spearheaded, involving the analysis of EEG data from nearly 30,000 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, each with data spanning approximately 5,000 time windows. This vast matrix of data provided a robust foundation for our statistical analysis and signal processing, allowing us to characterize neurological activity patterns associated with the disease in unprecedented detail.

As the project leader, my responsibilities mirrored those of my previous successful projects. I was the principal coder, adeptly managing the data from the source, applying filters to the signals, and outputting the results as pandas dataframes. The project was developed in Jupyter notebooks, utilizing a familiar suite of Python tools including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and various other libraries for efficient data management.

My leadership skills were pivotal in guiding a team of 4 through the project's lifecycle. I employed effective time management strategies, ensuring that we adhered to our schedule and met our milestones. My approach to project management was proactive and agile, which was instrumental in navigating the complexities of such a large dataset without delays.

The achievements of this project were multifaceted. We successfully characterized distinctive neurological features associated with Parkinson's disease, such as sibilancies and crepitancies, through rigorous statistical analysis and signal processing techniques. Our work provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and has the potential to influence future research, diagnosis, and treatment strategies.

Despite the inability to share specific details of our analyses due to privacy considerations, the project stands as a testament to our commitment to advancing scientific knowledge in the field of neurological disorders. It also highlights my capabilities in leading a team, managing large datasets, and leveraging Python's powerful analytical tools to achieve significant scientific advancements
